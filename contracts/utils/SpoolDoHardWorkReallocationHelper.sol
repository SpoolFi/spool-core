/**
 * @notice Spool part of implementation dealing with the do hard work
 *
 * @dev
 * Do hard work is the process of interacting with other protocols.
 * This process aggregates many actions together to act in as optimized
 * manner as possible. It optimizes for underlying assets and gas cost.
 *
 * Do hard work (DHW) is executed periodically. As users are depositing
 * and withdrawing, these actions are stored in the buffer system.
 * When executed the deposits and withdrawals are matched against
 * eachother to minimize slippage and protocol fees. This means that
 * for a normal DHW only deposit or withdrawal is executed and never
 * both in the same index. Both can only be if the DHW is processing
 * the reallocation as well.
 *
 * Each strategy DHW is executed once per index and then incremented.
 * When all strategies are incremented to the same index, the batch
 * is considered complete. As soon as a new batch starts (first strategy
 * in the new batch is processed) global index is incremented.
 *
 * Global index is always one more or equal to the strategy index.
 * This constraints the system so that all strategy DHWs have to be
 * executed to complete the batch.
 *
 * Do hard work can only be executed by the whitelisted addresses.
 * The whitelisting can be done only by the Spool DAO.
 *
 * Do hard work actions:
 * - deposit
 * - withdrawal
 * - compound rewards
 * - reallocate assets across protocols
 *
